## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Nodejs, React, Vite

I built the application using React and Vite to leverage the speedy development that Vite enables. I was able to quickly see changes as they were made because of HMR. I designed the application using two unique apis. I leveraged the GeoDBCities API to collect geographic data for the input cities. I implemented the OpenWeatherAPI to retrieve the weather data for each location.

<!-- ## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->
